The user from here is able to filter search criteria locategd on the left side of the screen. There are five criterias by which the data can be filted: date, city, state, country and shape of UFO recorded. In the text field there is an example text of how the search criteria must be entered, once the user begins to fill in the desired field the example text is replaced. User must hit "Enter", "Tab" or click outside of the text box in order for the filter to display the requested data. If there is no data matching the input by the user the data display table will be empty.

User is able to search the database using a combination of search criteria filters as needed. When more filters are applied, the more specific the data result will be. 

## Summary

Drawback to the current webpage design is the removal of the "Search" button. The "Seach" button instinctually guides the user to indicate the start of the search and the completion of filling in the filter search criteria. The current design may delay the user understanding that the data filter outputs search results automatically. 

In further development of the UFOs webpage, one should consider adding additional features to help navigate the page. One such example is adding a page navigation feature for output with a large result. This would allow the user to navigate the data with ease and create reference points for by creating a break in the result output.  Additionally, when developing this webpage one should consider inplementing a "Clear" button for the filter input data. This will allow the user to continue to the next search with ease by clearing all current input.
